## Inspiration

There are many plants in the world that are permanently disappearing due to environmental damage. To "preserve" these plants online, we created a website to share their beauty with our users. 

The goal is to help people choose to protect their environment for themselves and the next generations by looking at these beautiful images, which we hope to make our users feel more intimate to nature.


## What it does

(1) Top Navigation Bar

The top navigation bar allows users to quickly access the information they are looking for. There are three different sections: flowers, trees, and credits. When users click each section, the users will be directed to that specific section.

The top navigation bar is also responsive. If the screen size is too small to display the top navigation bar's sections, the sections will be hidden inside of a hamburger button (the button with three horizontal lines). 

We also included our logo, "P/P", which represents both "Plant the Planet" and "from People (our team) to People (users)".

(2) Home Page / Front Page

The home page shows the illustration of the Earth with our brand name and gradient backgrounds. The Earth is also responsive, increasing its size as the size of the screen is increasing. Below them, we added a short description of how we can protect the Earth -- by planting the new life, by growing our planet Earth's "lung", and by making our hope for the future together. 

To make the website more interesting to users, we also added a button "Pixelate!", which makes the entire website pixelated. 

(3) Main Content

The main content of this website is the list of endangered species that are grouped in two different sections: flowers and trees. 

The contents are also responsive. On a computer-sized screen, four cards would be displayed. On a tablet-sized screen, three cards would be displayed. On a phone-sized screen, two cards would be displayed. 

When users hover on each card, the spice's photo would be enlarged and shaded, and the spice's name and short description would appear. Users can also click on each card to see the detailed description. 

(4) Credits

Other than the ones that are specifically mentioned that no credit is necessary (such as Font Awesome), we listed out all resources in our credit page.
